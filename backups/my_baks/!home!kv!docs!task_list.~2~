Task list

Erlang module requirements:

1) each data feed* is a separate erlang process. Since each process is more
   lightweight then a regular thread we are able to  several thousands



------------
* data feed: basic input atom. It could be sensor signal, stock quote etc...
                  in the future we should be able to operate on N-dimensional
                  vectors (data feed array, data feed matrix...).
